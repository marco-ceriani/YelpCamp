= YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a yelp-like website where users can share reviews and comments on the best campgrounds in the world. I started this project as part of the awesome course by https://github.com/Colt[Colt Steele] on Udemy called "The Web Developer Bootcamp", then I added a few additional features added later, included a complete reimplementation of the UI from ejs to React.

== Requirements
To run the project you need to have installed Node.js and MongoDB.

== Features
Users can

- create, edit and delete campgrounds
- search for a campground by name
- leave comments on existing campgrounds
- list the campgrounds created by a user
- campgrounds can be geo located. Maps are included using OpenStreetMap
- the administrator can list all users and block or delete them
